Hamster Hotel
Replicate the prototype of a website with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

Peer Review: Madeline Gowan -- Overall it looks very good! Responsiveness is nice, I like the use of the hamburger menu on your navbar on smaller screen sizes. Below are some notes on more minor changes you could make to really perfect this project:
-Execution of the dropdown could be improved, the menu appears on top of the logo right now. Making the dropdown open at the bottom would be more effective. Alternatively, you could also turn it into an offcanvas.
-The cards under "Our Rooms" should not have rounded corners, border radius should be adjusted to more accurately represent the prototype.
-Images under "Packages" could use some work to make sure that the hamsters in the images are always visible. Right now your top image will cut off, showing only the heart and twine.
-Form shifts button to the next row as screen size gets smaller, could use organization so that smaller screen sizes the form lines expand and the button doesn't look lonely on it's own new row.
-On smaller screen sizes, the white space beneath the "Reservation" card feels awkward, it creates a divide that makes it feel as though something is missing. Maybe get rid of the white space underneath the reservation form once it hits a certain size, and allow the form to take up the full space.
-When hovering over the different navbar options, they do not have a white hover-border like they should. The prototype shows that on hover (when cursor is over the item) it displays a white border. Instead on your project the text turns blue.
-Navbar options are not linked up. use ids to make it so that when you click these options it scrolls to the different sections of the page.
Overall this looks great, it's just some smaller details that are left. Keep it up!!
